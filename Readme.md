# yvseann.com - Personal portfolio (WIP)

A small, single-page portfolio site used as a personal landing page and demo workspace. This repository is experimental - style and layout are a work in progress.

Overview
- Lightweight, easy to run locally: open the HTML file in any browser.

Quick start
1. Clone the repo
2. Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser (or just run a static server)
3. Edit [style.css](style.css) to change visual look

Project structure
- [index.html](index.html) — Main HTML file.
- [style.css](style.css) — main stylesheet; contains variables like [`--primary`](style.css) and responsive rules. This sucks
- images/ — image assets referenced by the page. You want them to make the website look semi-decent.
- [LICENSE](LICENSE) — license.
- .gitattributes — Git attributes.
