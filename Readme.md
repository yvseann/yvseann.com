# yvseann.com - Personal portfolio (WIP)

A small, single-page portfolio site used as a personal landing page and demo workspace. This repository is experimental - style and layout are a work in progress.

Overview
- Static HTML/CSS site with a small inline script for hero animation.
- Lightweight, easy to run locally: open the HTML file in any browser.

Quick start
1. Clone the repo
2. Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser (or just run a static server)
3. Edit [style.css](style.css) to change visual look

Project structure
- [index.html](index.html) — Main HTML file.
- [style.css](style.css) — main stylesheet; contains variables like [`--primary`](style.css) and responsive rules. This sucks
- images/ — image assets referenced by the page. You want them to make the website look semi-decent.
- profile/ — profile assets (Placeholder)
- [LICENSE](LICENSE) — license.
- reference.txt — personal notes for self
- .gitattributes — Git attributes.

Key Notes
- The hero uses a background image and an inline scroll animation (see the scroll listener in [index.html]
- Color theming uses the CSS custom property [`--primary`](style.css). Update that variable to change accent color across components.

Contributing
- Feel free to open an issue for bugs, feature ideas, or design suggestions. I suck at CSS.
- Pull requests are welcome - keep changes small, document intent in the PR, and target the main branch!
- If you submit styling or layout work please include screenshots/gifs in the PR description. This makes my job easier

License
- See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for license details!
